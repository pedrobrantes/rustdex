A terminal-based Pok√©dex application written in Rust. This project serves as both a useful tool for Pok√©mon fans and a professional portfolio piece demonstrating best practices in Rust software engineering, including a modular architecture, comprehensive testing, and an automated CI/CD pipeline.

## Features

* Fetch and display Pok√©mon data directly from the terminal.
* Render Pok√©mon sprites as high-definition terminal graphics.
* Configurable image width for different terminal sizes.
* Modular and scalable architecture.
* (Planned) Subcommands for fetching data on Moves, Items, and more.
* (Planned) Fully interactive TUI (Text-based User Interface) mode.

## Installation
